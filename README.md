Customer Retention &amp; Churn Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer retention and churn patterns using a real-world telecom customer dataset. Customer churn analysis is critical for subscription-based businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal of this analysis is to identify why customers leave, which segments are most at risk, and what actions a business can take to improve retention and long-term revenue.

Objectives

The key objectives of this analysis are to:

Measure overall customer churn and retention

Identify customer segments with high churn risk

Analyze churn patterns based on contract type, payment method, and tenure

Understand customer lifetime behavior

Provide actionable, business-focused recommendations to reduce churn

Dataset

The analysis uses the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which contains customer demographics, subscription details, payment methods, tenure, and churn status.

Key features include:

Contract type (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)

Payment method

Customer tenure

Monthly charges

Churn indicator (Yes / No)

Note: The dataset does not include customer signup dates, so retention analysis is performed using contract-based and behavioral segmentation rather than time-based cohorts.

 Tools Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Data cleaning, transformation, and churn analysis

Pandas & Matplotlib – Data manipulation and exploratory analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation and business storytelling

Microsoft Excel – Data inspection and validation


 Key Insights

The overall churn rate is approximately 26.5%, meaning nearly one in four customers leave the service.

Month-to-month contracts experience significantly higher churn compared to one-year and two-year contracts.

Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rates, while automated payment methods such as credit cards and bank transfers show stronger retention.

Most churn occurs within the first 6–12 months of customer tenure, highlighting the importance of early engagement and onboarding.

The highest-risk segment consists of month-to-month customers using electronic or mailed checks, while long-term contracts with automated payments show the lowest churn.


 Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard presents:

Overall churn and retention metrics

Churn and retention by contract type

Churn by payment method

Tenure-based churn patterns

Retention drivers through contract and payment segmentation

The dashboard is designed to simulate a real-world business presentation to stakeholders such as product managers or startup founders.


 Business Recommendations

Encourage customers to upgrade from month-to-month plans to longer-term contracts through incentives and loyalty programs.

Promote automated payment methods to reduce churn associated with manual payments.

Strengthen onboarding and early engagement strategies during the first year of subscription.

Implement targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customer segments.

Continuously monitor retention trends to evaluate the impact of retention strategies.

 Why This Project Matters

Customer retention analytics is a high-impact area in data science that directly affects revenue growth. This project demonstrates the ability to move beyond descriptive analytics and deliver actionable insights that support data-driven business decisions, making it highly relevant for real-world analytics roles.
