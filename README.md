Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

Data Science & Analytics – Task 2 (2026)
Future Interns

Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn and retention patterns using a telecom customer dataset. The objective is to understand why customers leave, identify high-risk segments, and provide actionable insights that can help a subscription-based business improve customer retention and long-term revenue.

Objectives

Analyze overall customer churn and retention

Identify customer segments with high churn risk

Examine churn patterns by contract type, payment method, and tenure

Understand customer lifetime behavior

Provide data-driven business recommendations to reduce churn

Dataset

The analysis uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer-level information such as contract type, payment method, tenure, monthly charges, and churn status.

The dataset does not include customer signup dates; therefore, retention analysis is based on contract type and customer behavior rather than time-based cohorts.

Tools Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas

Matplotlib

Power BI

Microsoft Excel

Key Insights

The overall churn rate is approximately 26.5%, meaning nearly one in four customers leave the service.

Month-to-month contract customers experience significantly higher churn compared to one-year and two-year contracts.

Customers using electronic checks show the highest churn rates, while automated payment methods such as credit cards and bank transfers have better retention.

Most churn occurs within the first 6 to 12 months of customer tenure, indicating the importance of early engagement and onboarding.

The highest-risk customers are those on month-to-month contracts using electronic or mailed checks, while long-term contracts with automated payments show the lowest churn.

Dashboard Summary

The Power BI dashboard presents overall churn and retention metrics, churn by contract type and payment method, tenure-based churn patterns, and key retention drivers. The dashboard is designed to support business decision-making and stakeholder presentations.
